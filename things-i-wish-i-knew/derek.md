## before college 🏫 
- **Once a goon, always a goon. 😭** There are so many people that attend every university/college and its ok if you don't immediately find your people or fail to connect with everyone! 
People say that college life is all about making a ton of new friends and while that is true, not everyone wants to be friends and thats ok 😁. 
There are so many clubs, extracurriculars, and on campus jobs as well as just chill people around campus that are always welcoming and looking for more bruzz (bro + huzz) to hang out with! 
I personally found things that I would never think of doing before college to be my favorite activities. Peer pressure (positive reinforcement) makes diamonds, and that really pushed me to jump out of my comfort zone with everything!
Me and my boys put ourselves out in the open for not even a month and I was sucked into some crazy stuff like downhill longboarding and hackathon farming. At the end of the day, no matter who you are, there's always w bruzz in the chat that attend your uni and you won't ever be alone (even if you feel like it 🙃)
- **Get sendy w it 🐎** The best day to start doing something is yesterday (especially in computer science). I always thought that I had to master the tech stack I was using before a hackathon, or that I had to spend 6 or 7 hours preparing to start something.
**Its not that deep.** Its ok to eat shit and learn from your mistakes. Its better to attempt something and fail than to miss an opportunity (pov u miss 4 OAs and have eternal depression 😭). 
- **Don't worry too much 🙏** You will end up wherever life takes you. Enjoy life, hang out with your friends, go play VALORANT in the esports center. Life isn't meant to be about j*bmaxxing or seeing how many Leetcode questions you can do.
I found that if I worry too much about the future, its just detrimental to my personal development and mental health. Sure, you could be missing the daily Leetcode question or the first ten minutes of the internship drop, but
at the end of the day we're all gonna find a way to live in this world 😮‍💨.

## reflection  
This is honestly really personal and kinda the first time I've looked back at myself this past year and a half. I was a sweat in high school and while getting rejected from my dream school I graduated high school with a hot 
Microsoft internship (shoutout Daniel and Hillary). However, college was a different story and being thrown straight into such a different environment killed me mentally and physically. My first quarter I was still an 
academic sweat but I was also super down from the constant rejections of applying to internships as a freshman with barely any technical experience (IG reels lied to me 💀). I was stuck in my shell up until spring quarter
when I discovered new hobbies and started actually talking to people 😭😭. Some may think that I missed out of the most important year of college but I think this was a great learning experience for me to keep being me 😁.

TLDR: stay based, never npc 💀🔥
